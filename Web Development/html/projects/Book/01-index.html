                <h4 style="text-align: center;">INTRODUCTION</h4>
                <p><span style="margin-left: 20px;">This collection of papers reflects the problems that I have worked
                        on over the years. With hindsight, it might appear that there had been a grand and premeditated
                        design to address the outstanding problems concerning the origin and evolution of the universe.
                        But it was not really like that. I did not have a master plan; rather I followed my nose and did
                        whatever looked interesting and possible at the time.</p>

                <p><span style="margin-left: 20px;">There has been a beat change in the status of general relativity and
                        cosmology
                        in the last thirty years. When I began research in the Department of Applied
                        Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP) at Cambridge in 1962, general
                        relativity waa regarded as a beautiful but impossibly complicated theory that had
                        practically no contact with the real world. Cosmology was thought of as a pseudoscience where
                        wild
                        speculation was unconstrained by any possible observations. That
                        their standing today is very different is partly due to the great expansion in the range
                        of observations made possible by modern technology. But it is also because we have
                        made tremendous progress on the theoretical side, and this is where I can claim to
                        have made a modest contribution.
                </p>

                <p><span style="margin-left: 20px">Before 1960, nearly all work on general relativity had been concerned
                        with solving the Einstein
                        equations in particular coordinate systems. One imposed enough
                        symmetry assumptions to reduce the field equations either to ordinary differential equations or
                        to
                        the Laplacian in three dimensions. It was regarded as a great
                        achievement to find any closed form solution of the Einstein equations. Whether it
                        had any physical significance was a secondary consideration. However a more geometric approach
                        began
                        to appear in the early 1960s in the work of Roger Penrose
                        and others. Penrose introduced global concepts and showed how they could be used
                        to establish results about spacetime singularities that did not depend on any exact
                        symmetries or details of the matter content of the universe. I extended Penrose’s
                        methods and applied them to cosmology. This phase of work on global properties
                        came to an end in about 1972 when we had solved most of the qualitative problems
                        in classical general relativity. The major problem that remains outstanding is the
                        Cosmic Censorship Conjecture. This is very difficult to prove, but all attempts to
                        find genuine counter-examples have failed, so it is probably true.
                </p>

                <p><span style="margin-left: 20px;">This global classical phase of my work is represented by the first
                        three papers in
                        this volume. They deal with the classical properties of the two themes that recur
                        throughout my work: the Big Bang and black holes. Nowadays everyone accepts it

                <p>as natural that the universe had a beginning about 15 billion years ago and that,
                    before that, time simply was not defined. But opinions were very different in the
                    early 1960s. The Steady State school believed that the universe had existed forever
                    more or less as we see it today. Even among those who thought the universe was
                    evolving with time, there was a general feeling that one could not extrapolate back to
                    the extreme conditions near the initial singularity of the Fkiedmann models and that
                    it was probably just an artifact of the high degree of symmetry of these solutions.
                    Indeed in 1963 Lifshitz and Khalatnikov claimed to have shown that singularities would not occur in
                    fully general solutions of the Einstein equations without exact
                    symmetries. Presumably this would have implied that the universe had a contracting
                    phase and some sort of bounce before the present expansion.</p>

                <p><span style="margin-left: 20px;">The discovery of the microwave background in 1964 ruled out the Steady State
                    Theory and showed that the universe must have been very hot and dense at some
                    time in the past. But the observations themselves did not exclude the possibility
                    th‘at the universe bounced at some fairly large but not extremely high density. This
                    was ruled out on theoretical grounds by the singularity theorems that Penrose and
                    I proved. The first singularity theorems involved the assumption that the universe
                    had a Cauchy surface. Thus they proved either that a singularity would occur or
                    that a Cauchy horizon would develop. But in 1970 Penrose and I published “The
                    Singularities of Gravitational Collapse and Cosmology” [l]. This was an all purpose
                    singularity theorem that did not assume the existence of a Cauchy horizon. It
                    showed that the classicd concept of time must have a beginning at a singularity in
                    the past (the Big Bang) and that time would come to an end for at least part of
                    spacetime when a star collapsed. Most of my work since then has been concerned
                    with the consequences and implications of these results.

                <p><span style="margin-left: 20px;">Up to 1970, my work had been concerned with cosmology and in particular with
                    the question of whether the universe had a beginning at a singularity in the past. But
                    in that year I realized that one could also apply the global methods that Penrose and
                    I had developed for the singularity theorems to study the black holes that formed
                    around the singularities that the theorems predicted would occur in gravitational
                    collapse. This was what Kip Thorne has called “The Golden Age of Black Holes”,
                    two or three years in which the concept of a black hole as an entity distinct from
                    the collapsing star was established and its main classical properties were deduced.
                    This was a case where theory definitely had the lead over observation. Black holes
                    were predicted theoretically some time before possible black hole candidates were
                    detected observationally.
