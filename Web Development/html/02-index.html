    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Red Fort</h1>

    <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːl qiːlaː]) is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of Delhi,
        India, that historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned
        construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally
        red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The
        fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace architecture
        with Indian traditions.</p>

    <p>The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in 1739. Most
        of the fort's marble structures were subsequently demolished by the British following the Indian Rebellion of
        1857. The fort's defensive walls were largely undamaged, and the fortress was subsequently used as a garrison.

    <p>On 15 August 1947, the first prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian flag above the Lahori
        Gate. Every year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the prime minister hoists the Indian tricolour flag at
        the fort's main gate and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts through the Public Address
        System of Indian Army Signals.</p>

    <p>The Red Fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the Red Fort Complex.</p>

    <h3>Etymology</h3>
    <p>The name Red Fort is a translation of the Hindustani Lāl Qila (Hindi: लाल क़िला, Urdu: لال قلعہ),[3][4] deriving
        from its red sandstone walls. Lal was derived from Hindustani language meaning "Red" and Qalàh derived from
        Arabic word meaning "Fortress". As the residence of the imperial family, the fort was originally known as the
        "Blessed Fort" (Qila-i-Mubārak).[5][6] Agra Fort is also known as Lāl Qila.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital
        from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, Shah Jahan's favourite colours,[7] its design is credited to
        architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal.[8][9] The fort lies along the Yamuna River,
        which fed the moats surrounding most of the walls.[10] Construction began in the sacred Islamic month of
        Muharram, on 13 May 1638.[11]: 01  Supervised by Shah Jahan, it was completed on 6 April 1648.[12][13][14]
        Unlike other Mughal forts, the Red Fort's boundary walls are asymmetrical to contain the older Salimgarh
        Fort.[11]: 04  The fortress-palace was a focal point of the city of Shahjahanabad, which is present-day Old
        Delhi. Shah Jahan's successor, Aurangzeb, added the Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) to the emperor's private
        quarters, constructing barbicans in front of the two main gates to make the entrance to the palace more
        circuitous.[11]: 08 </p>

    <p>The administrative and fiscal structure of the Mughal dynasty declined after Aurangzeb, and the 18th century saw
        a degeneration of the palace. In 1712 Jahandar Shah became the Mughal Emperor. Within a year of beginning his
        rule, Shah was murdered and replaced by Farrukhsiyar. In 1739, Persian emperor Nadir Shah easily defeated the
        strong Mughal army of around 200,000 soldiers,[15] plundering the Red Fort, including the Peacock Throne. Nadir
        Shah returned to Persia after three months, leaving a destroyed city and a weakened Mughal empire to Muhammad
        Shah.[11]: 09  The internal weakness of the Mughal Empire made the Mughals only titular rulers of Delhi, and a
        1752 treaty made the Marathas protectors of the throne at Delhi.[16][17] The 1758 Maratha victory at Sirhind
        aided by the Sikhs and successive defeat at Panipat[18] placed them in further conflict with Ahmad Shah
        Durrani.[19][20]</p>

    <h3>Archaeological finds</h3>
    <p>Archaeological excavations at the Red Fort have unearthed several Ochre Coloured Pottery culture artifacts dating
        from 2600 BCE to 1200 BCE.[40]</p>

    <h3>Modern era</h3>
    <p>The Red Fort, the largest monument in Delhi,[41] is one of its most popular tourist destinations[42] and attracts
        thousands of visitors every year.[43] It is a monument of national significance; every year on India's
        Independence Day (15 August), the prime minister of India hoists the country's flag at the Red Fort and delivers
        a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts.[44] The fort also appears on the back of the ₹500 note of the
        Mahatma Gandhi New Series of the Indian rupee.[45]</p>

    <h3>2000 terrorist attack</h3>
    <p>The Red Fort was the site of a terrorist attack on 22 December 2000, carried out by six Lashkar-e-Taiba members.
        Two soldiers and a civilian were killed in what the news media described as an attempt to derail India-Pakistan
        peace talks.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>To prevent terrorist attacks, security is especially strict around the Red Fort on the eve of Indian Independence
        Day. Delhi Police and paramilitary personnel keep a watch on neighbourhoods around the fort, and National
        Security Guard sharpshooters are deployed on high-rises near the fort.[48][49] The airspace around the fort is a
        designated no-fly zone during the celebration to prevent air attacks,[50] and safe houses exist in nearby areas
        to which the prime minister and other Indian leaders may retreat in the event of an attack.</p>

    <h3>Adoption controversy</h3>
    <p>In April 2018, Dalmia Bharat Group adopted the Red Fort for maintenance, development, and operations, per a
        contract worth ₹25 crores for a period of five years, under the government's "Adopt A Heritage" scheme.[51] The
        memorandum of understanding was signed with the ministries of Tourism and Culture, and the Archaeological Survey
        of India (A.S.I.).[52] The adoption of the fort by a private group left people divided and drew criticism from
        the public, opposition political parties, and historians. It also led to the #IndiaOnSale hashtag on
        Twitter.[53] In May 2018, the Indian History Congress called for the deal to be suspended until there is an
        "impartial review" of the deal "by the Central Advisory Board of Archaeology or any other recognised body of
        experts".</p>

    <h3>2021 Indian farmers' Republic Day protest</h3>
    <p>On 26 January 2021, during the 2021 Indian farmers' Republic Day protest, a section of the farmers reached and
        entered the fort and hoisted religious flags from the ramparts and climbed up the domes of the fort.[55] One of
        the farmers was seen climbing a flagpole in front of the fort and hoisting the religious flag Nishan Sahib on
        the flagpole.[56] The clash between police and farmers also caused damage to facilities inside the fort.[57] The
        fort was vacated following police announcements.</p>
